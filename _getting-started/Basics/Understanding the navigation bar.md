<h2>What is a navigation bar? </h2>
<p>Look on top of this site. Notice a bar of links?</p>
<p>The <strong>Navigation Bar</strong> brings all your pages and content together.
Itâ€™s a bar of links that always sits at the top of your site. Site visitors
can click on the links on the navigation bar to travel to different parts
of your site.</p>
<h3>Linking to the navigation bar </h3>
<p>I have created the "About us" folder but I am not able to access it anywhere
on the site. I would need to link "About us" folder to the navigation bar.</p>
