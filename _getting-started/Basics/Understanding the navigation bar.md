<h2>What is a navigation bar?</h2>
<p>Look on top of this site. Notice a bar of links?</p>
<p>The <strong>Navigation Bar</strong> brings all your pages and content together.
It’s a bar of links that always sits at the top of your site. Site visitors
can click on the links on the navigation bar to travel to different parts
of your site.</p>
<h3>Linking to the navigation bar</h3>
<p>I have created the "About us" folder but I am not able to access it anywhere
on the site. I would need to link "About us" folder to the <a href="https://cms.isomer.gov.sg/sites/ogp-iso-classic-trg/navbar" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">navigation bar</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What can I link? </h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/navbar.png">
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single pages</strong> are linked to the navigation bar when it
cannot be categorised with other pages but it is important enough to be
included. For example, “Contact Us” often stands alone in the navigation
bar without being nested under any folders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Folders</strong> allows you to organise pages with related content
together. Folder headers are often a summarised title of the content pages.
For example, organisations’ pages often have an “About Us” folder with
single pages to introduce their organisation, history and board of management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Menu Group</strong> allows you to add <strong>custom group</strong> of
links to your navigation bar. It can be used to link external resources
or pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For instance,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Menu Group is used to link past editions of event guides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These event guides are PDFs files and not pages within the site.</p>
