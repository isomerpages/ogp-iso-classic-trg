<h2><strong>“My Sites” dashboard</strong></h2>
<p>To access your site, you would have to log in to <a href="https://cms.isomer.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://cms.isomer.gov.sg/</u></a>

<br>Once you have logged in, your email will be captured in the Isomer system.
Sites that you have access to will be shown in the dashboard.</p>
