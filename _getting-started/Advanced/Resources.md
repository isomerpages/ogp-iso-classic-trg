<p>Every isomer site can only have 1 resource room. A resource room also
has a special layout that displays the latest 12 posts.</p>
<p>Your posts are sorted by date and you can filter them by year using the
date filter (Shown Recent)</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/resource_room.png">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>This can be created under Resource room in IsomerCMS.</p>
<p>Note that once the resource room is named, it cannot be changed anymore.
You would have to contact Isomer support for help.</p>
