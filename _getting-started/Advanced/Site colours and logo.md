<h2>Colours </h2>
<p>In Isomer, you can further customise your site by using colours. Colours
is an important element of your site. It can bring out or even reinforce
the branding and personality of the agency. Each Isomer website allows
for two main colours - a primary colour and a secondary colour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, PA uses red for their primary and secondary colours.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Site examples/pa_fullsite.png">
</div>
